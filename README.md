# AntackWin
Antack Missile Action Game in T3D Engine (2002)

Requirements:
A Computer with at least 350MHz recommended.
OpenGL also required.

#How to play
1. Double Click the Antack application file
2. At the Level Select screen choose your difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)
3. During game play hit the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 keys at the top of your keyboard
to launch ant armies at the enemy hill bases.
Aim at incoming Red Armies and fire your anti-antcraft weapon to defend your bases.
4. Use the W, A, S, D keys to move around the world and get a better defensive position.
5. Finish each level by destroying all six enemy bases.
Hints
1. You have only 4 seconds from an enemy launch to target and fire a defense missile.
2. Every 10 seconds the enemy bases regenerate some strength, so try to completely
annihilate a base before choosing to attack another base.
